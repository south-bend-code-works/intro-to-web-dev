# Project Part 2: Virtual Pet

## Goal

At the end of this portion of the project, you will have completed the Virtual Pet project started in part 1. It will include 3 buttons that will increase (and decrease) your pet's stats. Your pet will "react" to it's state by changing it's image.

## Overview

Now that all of the "physical" components of your pet are in place, we now need to make the your page functional. As is, there are 3 buttons that do nothing, stats that don't change, and a static picture. We are going to use JavaScript to make this whole thing come to life. Prepare yourself, this might just be fun.
