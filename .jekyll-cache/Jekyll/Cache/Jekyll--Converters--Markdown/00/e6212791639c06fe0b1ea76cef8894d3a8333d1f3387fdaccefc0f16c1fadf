<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>At the end of this portion of the project, you will have completed the Virtual Pet project started in part 1. It will include 3 buttons that will increase (and decrease) your petâ€™s stats. Your pet will â€œreactâ€ to itâ€™s state by changing itâ€™s image.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Now that all of the â€œphysicalâ€ components of your pet are in place, we now need to make the your page functional. As is, there are 3 buttons that do nothing, stats that donâ€™t change, and a static picture. We are going to use JavaScript to make this whole thing come to life. Prepare yourself. Youâ€™re about to become the parent of a Virtual Pet.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s make sure we can see our project in the browser. Go to your desktop and find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtual-pet</code>. Open that folder, right-click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>, and open in Chrome. If you see what we made in part 1, youâ€™re set.</p>

<p>Next, since we are going to add JavaScript to this page, we need a place to put it. The JS will go between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> tags that will live just beneath your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> tags.</p>
