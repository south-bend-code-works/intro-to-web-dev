<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>At the end of this portion of the project, you will have completed the Virtual Pet project started in part 1. It will include 3 buttons that will increase (and decrease) your pet’s stats. Your pet will “react” to it’s state by changing it’s image.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Now that all of the “physical” components of your pet are in place, we now need to make the your page functional. As is, there are 3 buttons that do nothing, stats that don’t change, and a static picture. We are going to use JavaScript to make this whole thing come to life. Prepare yourself. You’re about to become the parent of a Virtual Pet.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>Let’s make sure we can see our project in the browser. Go to your desktop and find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtual-pet</code>. Open that folder, right-click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>, and open in Chrome. If you see what we made in part 1, you’re set.</p>

<p>Next, since we are going to add JavaScript to this page, we need a place to put it. The JS will go between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> tags that will live just beneath your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> tags.</p>

<div class="hint">Hover for hint</div>

<div class="language-plaintext hint-content highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;

  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once these are included, we are ready to start coding some JavaScript!</p>

<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>

<p>Last time, we made a button for each of the activities: eating, drinking, and exercising. Right now, if we click on any of the buttons, nothing happens. Let’s change that.</p>
