<h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>

<p>Welcome to the web portal for Intro to Web Development! We are excited youâ€™re here.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to want to learn more about coding, computer programming, and other computer science topics, and all of them are valid. Our passion is helping to break down barriers for individuals who want to learn more about these concepts but arenâ€™t sure where to begin.</p>

<p><strong>Even though itâ€™s likely that youâ€™ve already read the course description, here it is again:</strong></p>

<p>This course is for students who have zero (or limited) prior coding/programming experience. If youâ€™ve been wondering how to break into the world of programming and get hands-on, practical experience building web applications as a non-computer science major this course is for you.</p>

<p>Web development has become an exciting and versatile field. Technologies and tools have advanced to the point where anyone with enough fundamental knowledge can spin up a web app, launch it online, and share it with the world.</p>

<p>Although web development has a lot of hype, the barriers to entry can feel somewhat daunting to those approaching these technologies for the first time. Our mission is to make web development approachable and computer science a little less scary. In this course, we will demystify programming for the web, become acquainted with databases, and deploy web applications online.</p>
