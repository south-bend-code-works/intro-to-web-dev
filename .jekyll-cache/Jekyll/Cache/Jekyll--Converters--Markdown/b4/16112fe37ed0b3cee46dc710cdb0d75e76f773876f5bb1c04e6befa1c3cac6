<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>At the end of this portion of the project, you will have completed the Virtual Pet project started in part 1. It will include 3 buttons that will increase (and decrease) your petâ€™s stats. Your pet will â€œreactâ€ to itâ€™s state by changing itâ€™s image.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Now that all of the â€œphysicalâ€ components of your pet are in place, we now need to make the your page functional. As is, there are 3 buttons that do nothing, stats that donâ€™t change, and a static picture. We are going to use JavaScript to make this whole thing come to life. Prepare yourself, this might just be fun.</p>
