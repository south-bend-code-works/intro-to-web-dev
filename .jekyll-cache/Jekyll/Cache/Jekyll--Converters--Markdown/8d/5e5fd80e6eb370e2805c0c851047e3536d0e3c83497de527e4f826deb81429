<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>At the end of this portion of the project, you will have completed the Virtual Pet project started in part 1. It will include 3 buttons that will increase (and decrease) your pet’s stats. Your pet will “react” to it’s state by changing it’s image.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Now that all of the “physical” components of your pet are in place, we now need to make the your page functional. As is, there are 3 buttons that do nothing, stats that don’t change, and a static picture. We are going to use JavaScript to make this whole thing come to life. Prepare yourself. You’re about to become the parent of a Virtual Pet.</p>
